# FastasyncVoxelSniper-Documentation

This is a (preliminiary) repository that restores the lost wiki from the wayback machine. The deployed `index.html` is on the `gh-pages` branch.
We're always looking for people who help us to migrate this single file to a similar setup like https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared-Documentation/

Thanks for helping out!
