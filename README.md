# FastAsyncVoxelSniper-Documentation

This is a (preliminiary) repository that restores the lost wiki from the wayback machine. The deployed `index.html` is on the `gh-pages` branch, currently being migrated to Markdown files in the `gitbook` folder.  
These files are deployed to https://intellectualsites.gitbook.io/fastasyncvoxelsniper/
We're always looking for people who help us to migrate this single file to a similar setup like https://github.com/IntellectualSites/PlotSquared-Documentation/

Thanks for helping out!
